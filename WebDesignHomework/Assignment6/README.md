<p>Out of the three website ideas I proposed in last week's assignment, the one that stood out to me the most is a yoga tutorial website.<br /> Working on this website idea would align with my passions the most and let me experiment with design concepts to create something informative and aesthetically pleasing.<br /> The website's tone will be very professional, with images and descriptions of yoga poses paired with a relaxing style that complements mindfulness-based practice.</p>



<b>Reflection</b>

<p>After incorporating elements of balance into my yoga webpage, I definitely noticed a difference in the readability of the information on the page.<br /> The colors made the most noticeable change as it no only fit with the content of the page, but also made the page seem concruent with itself.<br /> My final design is very close to what I hoped for, and I'm excited to continue adding to it in the future. I did not use flote or margins and didn't run into any significant challenges when designing my page.</p>
