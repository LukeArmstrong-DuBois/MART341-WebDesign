The design choice I'm most proud of is the table I made under the picture of the yoga poses. It shows the names of the poses and how long I recommend holding them if you plan on doing them sequentially. I made sure that the tables were sized properly so viewers knew exactly what each section was referring to. 

I also like how the newsletter section at the bottom turned out. It was a little challenging to make it look the way I envisioned, but I'm happy with the result. 

This assignment was very intimidating due to the length of the task details, but after reading an online textbook and experimenting with Visual Studio code, I think I have a good understanding of the material and was able to make something really cool.
