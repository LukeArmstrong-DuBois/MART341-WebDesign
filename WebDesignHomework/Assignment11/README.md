<b>Here are all the techniques I used on my page.</b>

<b>Create a page with an external CSS style sheet.</b>
I linked both syle.css and font.css to my pages to improve their look and avoided having style elements in the "head" of my website. 

<b>Add hover effects to enhance interactivity.</b>
I incorporated hover effects on the three pictures of cats and the navigation section on my page. This significantly improved my navigation section as it now changes color and has an underline when you hover over it. 

<b>Use an external font that is self-hosted</b>
For this, I used Roboto in my body section to make the text on the page consistent, and I used Arial font on my heading 2. 

<b>Use an external font from a font library.</b>
I found "coiny-regular" on Google Fonts and used it as the heading for my page. It had a bubbly look that I really liked, so I put it in my font.css file and linked it to the rest of my pages. 

<b>Adjust font-weight for emphasis.</b>
I wanted to make sure the text on my page didn't blend together, so I used different font weights to draw attention to specific parts of my page and make sections distinct. 

<b>Align text or elements for a clean layout.</b>
I aligned the headings and images on my page to improve its symmetry and make the website look "cleaner."

<b>Use text decoration to add or remove underlines, lines through text, etc.</b>
I used text decoration on my navigation section to add underlines and capitalized text when you hover over it.
