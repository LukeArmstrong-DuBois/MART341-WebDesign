<h4>Question 1</h4>
In a web browser like Chrome, after you search for something, it sends a request to the server. In an instant, this information is processed, and you are sent back web content like HTML, images, and CSS. These are then pressed through the browser and then show up on your screen. 


<h4>Question 2</h4>
DOM, or Document Object Model, is a programming interface that represents information in a branching tree like a pattern, so developers using programs like Javascript can interpret and edit the information efficiently. 


<h4>Question 3</h4>
HTML, XML, and XHTML are all markup languages, but they are used in different ways to create web pages. 

HTML is the most widely used language due to its unrestricted nature. Once it's set up, stylistic elements like images can be added easily. 

XML describes information instead of displaying it like HTML. It doesn't render anything. 

XHTML is very similar to HTML but a little more restrictive, as its primary function is to work with XML. Due to its specialized nature, XHTML helps developers find issues more efficiently. 


<h4>Question 4</h4>
An HTML page must always include the following:
<ul>
<li>!DOCTYPE</li>
<li>root</li>
<li>head</li>
<li>body</li>
</ul>

Without exception, these four need to be included, or your page will not function. 


<h4>Question 5</h4>
While you can include multiple files called index.html, at least one needs to be at the top of your directory tree and act as the homepage. 


<h4>Question 6</h4>
When naming in your code, you want to make sure everything has clear and non-confusing names, which makes searching and editing easier when you need to fix something. You also don't want things to be named similarly, as that would make them blend together when you're looking for a specific section.
