3+ Pages—I made a home page and three other pages telling the viewer what utensils can be used to eat spaghetti.
 
Framework Integration and Styling  – I decided to use Bootstrap because the benefits mentioned on the course website made it appealing to me. I used it to style my navigator quickly. 

HTML5 Canvas - Each of my pages shows a utensil drawn with Canvas. I made forks, spoons, and chopsticks with simple shape elements. 

JavaScript Functionality – my home page has some javascript that changes the background color and pops a text box explaining what the viewer should do.
