Six steps to learn meditation:

Step 1. Find Location
Desc. Environment matters a lot when meditating, so make sure you find a quiet spot to practice.

Step 2. Begine Relaxing
Desc. When seated, try to loosen your body so it feels heavy. Any tension in your body can draw your action away from relaxing.

Step 3. Focus on Breathing
Desc. Closing your eyes and focusing on your breath can help you move from your mind into your body.

Step 4. Working with distractions
Desc. You're bound to have things pop into your mind; don't get discouraged when this happens. Return to focusing on your breathing.

Step 5. Be Mindful
Desc. When you're truly relaxed, you should begin noticing sensations, sounds, and feelings you've taken for granted throughout the day.

Step 6. Return When It Feels Right
Desc. When ready, slowly move your body to exit the practice. You should now be more relaxed and prepared to continue your day.
