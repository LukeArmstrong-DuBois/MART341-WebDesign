Three or more pages - on my final webiste I made four pages that tell the viwer some cool things they can do during winter. Playing in the snow, making and eating food, and celobating holidays. 

A clear, well-organized layout with strong usability - my page is organized in a way so infmation is clear and leagable and i utiled enughf white spage to avoid the page being all smashed together. 

Use of an external stylesheet- my website is linked to a stylesheet to change the look of the page along with the font. I added a lot to the style.css file because I wanted my final website to look the best I could make it. 

Apply at least one font. I used a different font in the information section to make it stand out from the rest of the page and draw the viewer's attention to the crucial information. 

At least one image - I used a lot of pictures on this website because I wanted to visually show the viewer all the cool things they can do during the winter. I also style my image sections so they are displayed in a cool way and not stacked on top of each other. 

At least one embedded media element - using iframe. I linked three external YouTube videos about having fun outside in the snow. 

Legible and organized - my code is easy to read and includes comments so others know what each section of the code's purpose is at a glance.
