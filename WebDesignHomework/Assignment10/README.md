<b>Before I Start</b>
This week, I'll be working on the index/ homepage for my pumpkin carving website. It will include a tutorial for the entire pumpkin carving process and be styled using CSS to fit the theme of the fall season and Halloween. 

<b>After I Finished</b>
On my website, I used additional techniques, such as text alignment, positioning, borders, background, and font colors.

My main goal for these style changes was to make the page's style feel cohesive. Most of my earlier websites had colors and images that didn't fit on the page and stood out. On my pumpkin carving website, I wanted all of the colors, boxes, headings, and text to match the theme and improve its overall look and feel. 

The text alignment and content positioning were done to improve the reliability of the information on the page and improve the rhythm as the viewer moved from section to section. I also included borders to make each section "pop" against the background so everything felt different. 

The colors of the background and text were intentionally chosen to give the page the look of a pumpkin. The background is contrasted by the light and deep oranges of the information sections to resemble the different colors of a pumpkin's skin, which you see during carving.
