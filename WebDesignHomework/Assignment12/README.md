I've been continuing work on my website since last week and added to the services. 

<b>Here are the six techniques I used on my page.</b>

<b>Sizing</b> 
I used this to manipulate the fonts on my page so that texts, such as those in the event section, could be varying sizes. 

<b>Border</b>
I used borders in my navigation section and dropdown menu to round their ends to give the page a bubbly look with no sharp corners. I also added a solid border around the three selectable in my dropdown so they stood out more. 

<b>Margin</b> 
I used this technique to avoid elements from touching each other and making the page feel cramped. I separated the cat images and event sections with margins. 

<b>Padding</b>
I used padding to separate my borders from the contained content. Both my footer and dropdown menu used this, and it really helped prevent the text from looking cramped in the borders. 

<b>Dropdown</b>
I built a dropdown menu that links to some pages that are in progress. My navigation section already links to the most important pages on my site, but this dropdown menu will be used in the future to take viewers to less important parts of my website. I'm very happy with how it looks. 

<b>Position</b>
I used this to control where my dropdown menu would appear when the viewer hovered over it. This was especially important when styling the content of my dropdown, as it would mess up my navigation section without the use of absolute position.
