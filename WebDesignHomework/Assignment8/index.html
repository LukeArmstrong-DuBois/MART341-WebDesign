    <h2><b>Why Practice Yoga?</b></h2>
    <div class="personal experience">
    <p><b>Here is why I started:</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Prevents <b>injury</b></li>
        <li>Forces you to be <b>mindful</b></li>
        <li>Good <b>exercise</b></li>
      </ul>
      <p>I started doing yoga in 2020 during the COVID lockdown because I couldn't go to my local gym.<br /> Over time, I started enjoying the practice, and it became my primary way of exercising.<br /> In 2022, I was able to teach yoga to 14-17-year-old kids, which deepened my <em>love</em> for the practice.</p>

      <p>Here is a quote from a yoga journal that captures why I practice:</p>
      <q>Yoga is a way to produce a chemistry of blissfulness. Once you are blissful by your own nature, you can deal with outside situations effortlessly.</q>
