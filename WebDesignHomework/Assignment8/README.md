From using divs to contain relevant code to including class spans and iframes to improve the neatness of my style elements and content included on the page, my website has improved dramatically due to the learning from this week. Not only does it look a lot better, but it is also easy to read in the original code, which was a problem I was having in the previous assessments. Elements like videos and audio were also included on my page this week, which now gives my website a professional feel and more stylistic elements to differentiate it from other sites. Finally, I showcased my ability to use escape characters by adding unique text elements to make my page information more concise.
