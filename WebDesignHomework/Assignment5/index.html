  <h3><b>Art Portfolio</b></h3>
  <p>My first website idea is to make a portfolio of recent creative projects I've worked on. I'd want this website to be calming and show how my art has changed over the years.</p>

  <h3><b>Pet Blog</b></h3>
  <p>My second idea is to create a website blog about my pets. I have many animals around my house, so I could write stories about the mischief they get into. <br /> This website will have a playful look.</p>

  <h3><b>Yoga Tutorials</b></h3>
  <p>My final idea is to create a website that describes and shows how to perform yoga poses. I've been practicing for over two years, so I could discuss the benefits while also including visual aids of what the poses should look like. <br />
     This website will have a calming tone to fit the page's content.</p>
