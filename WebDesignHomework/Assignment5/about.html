  <h1>Why I Chose These Website Ideas</h1>
</head>

<body>
    <h3><b>Art Portfolio</b></h3>
  <p>I chose this idea because it fits with my passions. I have many pieces of art that have never been uploaded to the Internet. <br /> This portfolio would be a hub for all my future works and allow friends and family to see my art.</p>

  <h3><b>Pet Blog</b></h3>
  <p>I chose this idea because I live with seven pets, and they are always doing exciting things. <br /> I also really like writing, so a blog about something significant to me (my animals) makes sense.</p>
  <hr />

  <h3><b>Yoga Tutorials</b></h3>
  <p>I chose this idea because I have been practicing yoga for a long time and have experience teaching classes. <br /> Making short yoga routines accessible on the website would be an interesting project, so this idea is my favorite out of the three I mentioned</p>
