<b>At Least 4 Pages</b>
I made a home, founder, donation, and event page on my website about collecting lemons. Each page feels distinct and includes different information, which is something I've been struggling with on previous assignments. 

<b>Responsive Design</b>
Using responsive design, I ensured that my website worked on all devices. Many parts of my page wouldn't look good on mobile devices if I hadn't added these elements. 

<b>Media Queries</b>
I used this technique to change the sizes of my images and elements to adapt to all screen sizes. 

<b>Navigation Menu</b>
I think the navigator at the top of my page does a good job explaining what each page is and letting viewers jump to specific information.

<b>Dropdown Menu</b>
My dropdown doesn't link to any real pages yet because the navigation section would have felt empty if the dropdown included the pages I made.
