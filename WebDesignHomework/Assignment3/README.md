# Problems and how I overcame them

One of the main problems I had with GitHub was creating a repository for this class. Because there are so many options available when you first boot up GitHub, I was a little **overwhelmed**. However I wanted to fix the issue, so so I began learning more about GitHub

#### To do this, I:

- Used the course website to get a better understanding of the material. 

- Explored Github more to get more comfortable navigating.

- Researched online to find people with similar issues to my own.

While working on this problem, I listened to this [album](https://youtu.be/ZlMqTCa6aro?si=PSxspssYByV8jpEn)
